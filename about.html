      <h3>History</h3>
      <p>At Savvy Coders, we began with a vision of reaching out to people traditionally underrepresented in the technology field. Partnering with several non-profit groups, we endeavored to give back to our communities by increasing tech talent and expanding business opportunities. We designed a comprehensive curriculum that would allow our students to expand their professional horizons in 12 weeks.</p>
      <p>With the values of quality, flexibility, and accessibility in mind, we offer courses open to anyone with a desire to learn. We challenge ourselves to meet the following goals:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>To make the tech field accessible to everyone, especially those underrepresented in the industry.</li>
        <li>To help communities succeed by providing tech talent that growing businesses need.</li>
        <li>To give students a comprehensive, fundamental understanding of software development skills including HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Firebase, Agile and more.</li>
        <li>To provide more value in this short time frame than other programs do in months, and help our students with internships, networking, and job placement post-graduation.</li>
